# Introduction

Asteria on **Hydra** is a real-time bot challenge designed to showcase the power of the extended UTxO (eUTxO) model within a Hydra Head.  
It highlights how Hydra enables **scalable, concurrent, and low-latency interactions** on top of Cardano.

Developers participate by building automated agents (bots) that interact directly with a Hydra Head.  
Each bot controls UTxOs constrained by on-chain validators, and submits state transitions through the Hydra network.

Once a challenge has been initialized, all interactions and rewards occur inside the Hydra Head — fully decentralized, with no administrators able to adjust mechanics.

## Game Overview

- Each bot controls a (space) ship represented by a UTxO (`ShipState`) inside the Hydra Head.
- The goal is to reach coordinates `(0, 0)`, the location of **Asteria**, in order to claim rewards.
- Movement is constrained by available fuel. Ships must plan carefully, gathering fuel from pellets scattered across the grid.
- Fuel pellets are represented by UTxOs (`PelletState`) that can be collected when a ship reaches their grid coordinates.

## Ongoing Challenges

- Multiple Hydra challenges (games) can run in parallel, each with its own participants and state.  
- Because all logic and scripts are open-source, anyone can start their own challenge with custom rules or rewards.  
- Gameplay is **fast and concurrent** — enabled by Hydra’s high-throughput UTxO processing.
